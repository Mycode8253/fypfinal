# Introduction
Hey group mates 
> This is a final year project git repository that I haved created with so much difficulty 

* If you want to add any features to the final year project (like if u have modified any thing to the code then make ur using git pull(i will explain you this in seperate files)
* I will be giving you the details of how to set up git hub and what does this all mean
* if you want to contribute  you can read the git manual which i will be including  :-) 
>First if u clone(download) this project .....then do it the normal way( i meant green button over top which downloads the zip folder ) but it  is not much helpfull if you want to add back yours changes directly to main project.
