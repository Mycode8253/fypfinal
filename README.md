# Introduction
Hey group mates 
> This is a final year project git repository that I haved created with so much difficulty 

* If you want to add any features to the final year project (like if u have modified any thing to the code then make changes visible by using git pull(i will explain you this in seperate files)
* I will be giving you the details of how to set up git hub and what does this all mean
* if you want to contribute  you can read the git manual which i will be including or you read online how to use git.
* Happy if i get help :-)  
> First if u clone (download) this project .....then do it the normal way( I meant green button over top which downloads the zip folder ) but it  is not much helpful if you want to add back yours changes (if you made any changes to code ) directly to main project.
But for seeing how the test is working you can download and run it.
What ever changes i make to the project will be reflected in this git repository from time to time. So you can keep up with it.
## HAPPY DOOPY










# Running this project:
For windows only because i did mine in windows......
Follow the steps to get the project running 
1. Download project from the green clone icon(right side top) top make sure to be in master branch (left side) using the zip file.
1. Unzip it (obviously you will do it).
1. Open the command prompt
1. Install python if you dont have it ( from the official python website )
1. Install Pillow
  1. pip install pillow
  1. if pillow didnt install or if you get any "wheel blah blah ...." error then you can install from this website https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pillow -  this file is already their in the resources folder so.........
  1. If i find the file in the resources then do "pip install .\resources\PyAudio-0.2.11-cp38-cp38-win_amd64.whl" make sure to be in the project directory in the command line prompt.
  1. If it didnt work out then Google it in online u will get in online mostly a youtube when u search it.
  
1. pip install SpeechRecognition 
1. Then open the command prompt in the directory where y unzipped it 
1. Make sure the the commad prompt is in project directory when u do the command "dir" in command prompt u should all the files of the project.
1. "python startingPage.py" - command will start the project .....observe the terminal outputs ......
1. when "speak' comes on command prompt try to speak out what ever letter comes on the UI or any picture name like "boat" "windmill" "boat "
"computer"
1. It may be shitty but it will improve.(learning test is perfectly optimised)

# File descriptions
1. 'learningtest.py' - Letter fluency test
1. 'Image_test_Dyslexia.py'  - Initial fluency test
1. 'phenome####.py' - still not ready ppl
> Please try to create another test some how using python if u can do the GUI using tkinter and send me the code because i have to do other modifications like adding few stuff that is going to take time so if you want to get it done fast do the third test with GUI preferably and send the code to me
